non monetory posts - fields: ID,Awardee, awarded by, type of award (default value non-monetory), points added, award name, date and time, description

all the rows from monetory and non monetory posts should be added in posts table

If you are using the App Router, try to avoid using the SessionProvider and use getServerSession instead to get access to the session object as using SessionProvider should be unnecessary in most cases. However, using the SessionProvider can be useful if you are migrating from the older pages router.
